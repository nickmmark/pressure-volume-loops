### Parameters to define a PV loop
For simplicity, we can define a PV loop with just 6 points and one curve.
* A  = Mitral Valve opens
* B =
* C = Mitral valve closes
* D = Aortic valve opens
* E = Peak ventricular ejection
* F = Aortic valve closes

A second order polynomial defines the appearance of the ejection curve. Three coefficients (a, b, c) define this curve.
